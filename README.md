## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the e-commerce company better understand its customers and their shopping experiences. It enables the company to evaluate customer satisfaction with their services, identify areas for improvement, and enhance overall service quality. By analyzing various metrics and feedback ratings, the company can pinpoint specific issues that may contribute to customer dissatisfaction.

The dashboard also highlights key insights into order processing times, delivery delays, and the effectiveness of customer support. By identifying bottlenecks or inefficiencies, the company can address these issues to provide a smoother and more satisfying experience for customers.

Since the proportion of neutral or dissatisfied customers (approximately 57%) is higher than satisfied customers (around 43%), the company should prioritize enhancing service efficiency, delivery reliability, and customer support.

Additionally, with an average delivery delay of 15 minutes, it is crucial for the e-commerce company to focus on reducing delays in order fulfillment and delivery processes to improve customer satisfaction and retention.

Here’s a tailored version of your content, rewritten for a bank loan report:

Bank Loan Application Analysis Report
Report Summary:
This report analyzes customer feedback and operational data for bank loan applications to help improve services and customer satisfaction. The report was created in Power BI Desktop and subsequently published to Power BI Service. Key insights, metrics, and ratings were derived to assist the bank in identifying areas for improvement.

Metrics and Calculations:
Step 1: Loan Parameters and Average Ratings
Key parameters affecting customer satisfaction were identified and analyzed. Some parameters were assigned a value of 0, representing non-applicability for certain customers. These values were excluded when calculating average ratings.

The following parameters and average ratings were recorded:

Loan Disbursement Time: 3.63/5
Customer Support: 3.31/5
Application Process Cleanliness: 3.29/5
Ease of Online Loan Application: 2.88/5
Loan Information Transparency: 3.21/5
Interest Rate Competitiveness: 3.36/5
Loan Repayment Options: 3.64/5
Online Support Services: 2.81/5
Branch Assistance: 3.37/5
Mobile App Functionality: 3.38/5
Approval Notification Process: 3.33/5
Loan Amount Customization: 3.44/5
Processing and Approval Convenience: 3.22/5
Step 2: Key Visualizations Added to the Dashboard
Bank Name and Tagline: Displayed using text boxes.
Logo: Inserted as an image for branding.
Age Group Segmentation: A calculated column was created to group customers by age using the following DAX expression:
DAX
Copy code
Age Group = 
IF(loan_application_data[Age]<=25, "0-25 (25 included)",
IF(loan_application_data[Age]<=50, "25-50 (50 included)",
IF(loan_application_data[Age]<=75, "50-75 (75 included)",
"75-100 (100 included)")))
Step 3: Total Count of Customers
A measure was created to count the total number of loan applicants:

DAX
Copy code
Count of Customers = COUNT(loan_application_data[ID])
The total number of applicants was 129,880, represented via a card visual.

Step 4: Customer Distribution by Type
Using the DAX measure below, percentages of applicants were calculated for different loan types:

DAX
Copy code
% Customers = (DIVIDE(loan_application_data[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
Step 5: Total Loan Amount Disbursed
To calculate the total loan amount disbursed:

DAX
Copy code
Total Loan Amount = SUM(loan_application_data[Loan Amount])
Insights from the Dashboard:
1. Total Applicants
Total Number of Applicants: 129,880
Satisfied Applicants (Male): 21.68%
Satisfied Applicants (Female): 21.76%
Neutral/Unsatisfied Applicants (Male): 27.58%
